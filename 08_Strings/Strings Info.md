# C++ Strings
## C++ Strings
Strings are used for storing text.

A `string` variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

### Example
Create a variable of type `string` and assign it a value:
```c++
string greeting = "Hello";
```

To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the `<string>` library:

### Example
```c++
// Include the string library
#include <string>

// Create a string variable
string greeting = "Hello";
```
