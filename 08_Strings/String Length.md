# C++ String Length
## String Length
To get the length of a string, use the `length()` function:

### Example
```c++
string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.length();
```


**Tip:** You might see some C++ programs that use the ``size()`` function to get the length of a string. This is just an alias of ``length()``. It is completely up to you if you want to use `length()` or ``size():``

### Example
```c++
string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
cout << "The length of the txt string is: " << txt.size();
```
